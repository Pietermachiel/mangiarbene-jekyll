Sourdough bread is made by the fermentation of dough using naturally-occurring lactobacilli and yeast.

Sourdough bread has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker's yeast and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli.

Use flour from the mill.
