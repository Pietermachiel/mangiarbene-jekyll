I"ê<p>In the Chez Panisse CafÃ© Cookbook, the follow-up to the award-winning Chez Panisse Vegetables, Alice Waters and her team of talented cooks offer more than 140 of the cafÃ©â€™s best-recipesâ€“some that have been on the menu since the day cafÃ© opened and others freshly reinvented with the honesty and ingenuity that have made Chez Panisse so famous. In addition to irresistible recipes, the Chez Panisse CafÃ© Cookbook is filled with chapter-opening essays on the relationships Alice has cultivated with the farmers, foragers and purveyorsâ€“most of them within an hourâ€™s drive of Berkeleyâ€“who make it possible for Chez Panisse to boast that nearly all food is locally grown, certifiably organic, and sustainably grown and harvested.</p>
