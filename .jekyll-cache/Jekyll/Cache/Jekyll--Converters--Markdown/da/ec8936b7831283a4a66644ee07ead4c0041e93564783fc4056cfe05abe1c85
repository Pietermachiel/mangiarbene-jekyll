I"Y<p>While Ferran Adrià is better known for his innovative and ground breaking gastronomic creations, this highly anticipated new book reveals, for the first time, his secrets for creating delicious, seasonal, and simple home cooked meals.</p>

<p>The Family Meal’s mouth-watering recipes are inspired by the dishes eaten by the staff of Ferran’s restaurant, the legendary elBulli, four-time recipient of the World’s Best Restaurant Award. Every day at 6pm, Ferran’s team stops what they are doing to sit down to eat a three-course dinner together - this is known as the ‘family meal’.</p>
