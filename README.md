# Jekyll/React API endpoint demo

## Jekyll version

With Jekyll it is very well possible to create API endpoints, so blog and collections can be consumed in other website generators.

This **Jekyll** website [MangiarBene/Jekyll](https://trim-seahorse.cloudvent.net/) also provides the same data as API endpoint and is consumed by the equivalent **React** website [Mangiarbene/React](https://api.roozen.nl) .
