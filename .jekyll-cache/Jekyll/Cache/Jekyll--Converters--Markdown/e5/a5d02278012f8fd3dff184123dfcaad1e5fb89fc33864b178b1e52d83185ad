I"¨<p>â€˜Ottolenghi changed the way we cook in this country just as surely and enduringly as Elizabeth Davidâ€™s A Book of Mediterranean Food had in 1950. It brought into our kitchens bold flavours, a vivid simplicity, a spirited but never tricksy inventiveness and, above all, light.â€™ Nigella Lawson</p>

<p>Inspired by their childhoods in West and East Jerusalem, Yotam Ottolenghiâ€™s and Sami Tamimiâ€™s original cookbook Ottolenghi: The Cookbook showcases fresh, honest, bold cooking and has become a culinary classic.</p>

<p>Yotam and Samiâ€™s inventive yet simple dishes rest on numerous culinary traditions, ranging from North Africa to Lebanon, Italy and California. First published in 2008, this new updated edition revisits the 140 original recipes covering everything from accomplished meat and fish main courses, through to healthy and quick salads and suppers, plus Ottolenghiâ€™s famously delectable cakes and breads.</p>
